Hi, I am Kai Huang `/kaɪ hʊʌŋ/`, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). My advisor is Dr. [Wei Gao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~weigao/), who leads the Mobile Systems & Networking Lab. 

My research aims for 1) providing modular, interpretable, and lightweight AI solutions to enhancing performance of wireless communication systems; 2) building efficient neural network inference/training systems, such as mobile AI. Here is my [CV](http://hellokevin07.github.io/files/CV_KaiHuang.pdf). 

I enjoy jogging, ice skating, skiing, and listening to lofi music.
