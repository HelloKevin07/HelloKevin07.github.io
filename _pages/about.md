Hi, I am Kai Huang `/kaɪ hʊʌŋ/`, currently a fourth-year PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/),  supervised by [Dr. Wei Gao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~weigao/). I have broad interests in AI for Systems, On-Device AI, Mobile and Edge Computing.

Here is my [CV](http://hellokevin07.github.io/files/CV_KaiHuang.pdf). My research aims to (1) design efficient AI inference/training schemes for weak embedded devices, e.g., MCU boards, Raspberry Pi, and Nvidia Jetson; (2) tailor AI models based on domain knowledge, e.g., provide modular, interpretable, and lightweight AI solutions to enhance performance of wireless communication systems (e.g., WiFi and backscatter). Thanks to my amazing colleagues and advisor, these efforts are turning into publications in top-tier system conferences, e.g., ACM MobiCom, MobiSys, and SenSys.
