Hi, I am Kai Huang `/kaɪ hʊʌŋ/`, currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). My advisor is [Dr. Wei Gao](https://sites.pitt.edu/~weigao/), who leads the Mobile Systems & Networking Lab. 

**Research Interests:** AI for Systems, On-Device AI, Mobile Computing, Edge Computing

My research aims for 1) providing modular, interpretable, and lightweight AI solutions to enhancing performance of wireless communication systems; 2) building efficient neural network inference/training systems, e.g., on MCU boards, Raspberry Pi, and Nvidia Jetson. Thanks to my amazing colleagues and advisor, these efforts are turning into publications in top conferences, e.g., ACM MobiCom, MobiSys, and SenSys. Here is my [CV](http://hellokevin07.github.io/files/CV_KaiHuang.pdf).
